<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>
Nash's "CHOISE OF VALENTINES" has apparently come
down to us only in manuscript form. It is extremely
doubtful (Oldys notwithstanding<a name="Iar" id="Iar"></a><a href="#Ia"><sup>a</sup></a>), whether the poem was
ever before accorded the dignity of print. Nor would it
now be deemed worthy of such were the only considerations
those of literary merit or intrinsic value: truth to tell there
is little of either to recommend it. But, as it has been
repeatedly said, and well insisted on, the world cannot
afford to lose any "document" whatsoever which bears, or
<i>may</i> bear, in the slightest degree, on the story of its own
growth and development, and out of which its true life has
to be written. Especially is even the meanest Elizabethan of
importance and value in relation to the re-construction&mdash;still
far from complete&mdash;of the life and times of the
immortal bard of Avon. In the most unlikely quarters a
quarry may yet be found from which the social historian
may obtain a valuable sidelight on manners and customs,
the philologist a new lection or gloss, or the antiquary a
solution to some, as yet, unsolved problem.</p>
<p>
"The Choise of Valentines" claims attention, and is
of value principally on two grounds, either of which, it is
held, should amply justify the more permanent preservation<a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;viii]</span>
now accorded this otherwise insignificant production.
In the first place, it appears to have been dedicated to the
Earl of Southampton, the generous patron of letters, and
friend of Shakspeare; and second, it is probably the only
example extant of the kind of hackwork to which Nash was
frequently reduced by "the keenest pangs of poverty."<a name="Ibr" id="Ibr"></a><a href="#Ib"><sup>b</sup></a>
He confesses he was often obliged "to pen unedifying
toys for gentlemen." When Harvey denounced him for
"emulating Aretino's licentiousness" he admitted that
poverty had occasionally forced him to prostitute his pen
"in hope of gain" by penning "amorous Villanellos and
Quipasses for new-fangled galiards and newer Fantisticos."
In fact, he seems rarely to have known what it was to be
otherwise than the subject of distress and need. As an
example of these "unedifying toys" the present poem
may, without much doubt, be cited, and an instance in
penning which his "hope of gain" was realised.</p>
<p>
It is a matter of history that Nash sought, and
succeeded in obtaining for a time, the patronage of the
Earl of Southampton, one of the most liberal men of his
day, and a prominent figure in the declining years of
Elizabeth. "I once tasted," Nash writes in 1593,<a name="Icr" id="Icr"></a><a href="#Ic"><sup>c</sup></a> "the
full spring of the Earl's liberality." Record is also made
of a visit paid by him to Lord Southampton and Sir
George Carey, while the former was Governor, and the
latter Captain-General, of the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>
From internal evidence it would seem that this poem
was called forth by the Earl's bounty to its author. "My<a name="pageix" id="pageix"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;ix]</span>
muse devorst from deeper (the <i>Rawl. MS.</i> reads <i>deepest</i>)
care, presents thee with a wanton elegie;" and further on,
the dedication promises "better lines" which should "ere
long" be penned in "honour" of his noble patron. This
promise is renewed in the epilogue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"My mynde once purg'd of such lascivious witt,</p>
  <p class="i2">With purifide words and hallowed verse,</p>
  <p class="i2">Thy praises in large volumes shall rehearse,</p>
  <p class="i2">That better maie thy grauer view befitt."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Does this refer to "The Unfortunate Traveller; or, The
Life of Jack Wilton," generally regarded as Nash's most
ambitious work, and which he dedicated to Lord
Southampton in 1593? If so, and there is no evidence
to gainsay the conclusion, we can fix the date of the
present poem as, at all events, prior to 17th September of
that year, when "The Unfortunate Traveller" was entered
on the Stationers' Register.<a name="Idr" id="Idr"></a><a href="#Id"><sup>d</sup></a> This would make Nash
contemporaneous, if not prior to, Shakspeare in offering a
tribute to the merits of the young patron (Southampton
at that time was barely twenty years old) of the Muses.
<i>Venus and Adonis</i> was entered on the Register of the
Stationers' Company about five months earlier, on the<a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;x]</span>
18th April, 1593, and barely more than two months prior
to the registration of "The Terrors of the Night."</p>
<p>
It is curious to note that while Shakspeare and Nash
both promise "graver work" and "better lines," they alike
select amatory themes for their first offerings. The promise
in Shakspeare's case was redeemed by the dedication to
Southampton of "The Rape of Lucreece," while it may
be assumed, as aforesaid, that Nash followed suit with
"The Unfortunate Traveller."</p>
<p>
Nash, however, for some cause or other failed to
retain the Earl's interest; "indeed," says Mr. Sidney Lee,
"he did not retain the favour of any patron long." It is
only fair to state, however, that the withdrawal of Lord
Southampton's patronage may not have been due to any
fault or shortcoming on the part of Nash, for there is
likewise no evidence whatever to show that any close
intimacy existed between Southampton and Shakspeare
after 1594. Probably there was much else to claim Lord
Southampton's attention&mdash;his marriage, and the Essex
rebellion to wit. This, however, leads somewhat wide of
the present work.</p>
<p>
So much for the circumstances which appear to have
called forth "The Choise of Valentines." The next consideration
is, Has it ever appeared in print before? Oldys,
in his MS. notes to Langbaine's <i>English Dramatic Poets</i>
(<i>c</i>. 1738) says:&mdash;"Tom Nash certainly wrote and published
a pamphlet upon Dildos. He is accused of it by his
antagonist, Harvey." But he was writing nearly 150
years after the event, and it is certainly very strange that
a production which it can be shown was well known<a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;xi]</span>
should, if printed, have so entirely disappeared. At
all events, no copy is at present known to exist.<a name="Ier" id="Ier"></a><a href="#Ie"><sup>e</sup></a> John
Davies of Hereford alludes to it, but leaves it uncertain
whether its destruction occurred in MS. or in print. In
his "Papers Complaint"<a name="Ifr" id="Ifr"></a><a href="#If"><sup>f</sup></a> he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But O! my soule is vext to thinke how euill</p>
<p>It is abus'd to beare suits to the Deuill.</p>
<p><i>Pierse-Pennilesse</i> (a <i>Pies</i> eat such a patch)</p>
<p>Made me (agree) that business once dispatch.</p>
<p>And having made me vndergo the shame,</p>
<p>Abusde me further, in the Deuills name:</p>
<p>And made [me] <i>Dildo</i> (dampned Dildo) beare,</p>
<p>Till good men's hate did me in peeces teare.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
As regards the manuscript copies there are one or two
points worthy of note. At present we know of two, more
or less incomplete, but each of which supplements, in some
degree, the other. These MSS. are respectively in the
Bodleian (Rawl. MS. Poet, 216) and the Inner Temple
(Petyt MS. 538, vol. 43, p. viii., 295b.) libraries. Both
texts are obviously corrupt, the Rawlinson abominably so.
Probably the former was written out from memory alone,
while the Petyt, if not a transcript direct from the original
is, at any rate, very near to it.</p>
<p>
The Bodleian version is written on paper in a small
oblong leather-covered book, originally with clasps. The
penmanship is early 17th century, probably about 1610-20.
It is thus catalogued:&mdash; ..."<i>E libris</i> Matt.<a name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;xii]</span>
Postlethwayt, Aug. 1, 1697. Perhaps (earlier) Henry
Price owned the book." The volume contains besides an
English transcript of Ovid's "Arte Amandis" and some
amatory poems.<a name="Igr" id="Igr"></a><a href="#Ig"><sup>g</sup></a> The date of the Petyt text may be
about.... It is written in a miscellaneous, folio,
commonplace-book, and in the catalogue it is described as
"an obscene poem, entitled 'The Choosing of Valentines,'
by Thomas Nash. The first 17 lines are printed at p. lx.
of the Preface to vol i. of Mr. Grosart's edition of Nash's
works, as if they formed the whole piece."<a name="Ihr" id="Ihr"></a><a href="#Ih"><sup>h</sup></a></p>
<p>
Nothing is known of Postlethwayt and Price, who at
one time owned the Rawlinson copy, that throws light on
its source. In the Petyt, however, we get a suppositional
explanation of its manifestly purer text. Petyt, subsequent
to his call to the Bar, in 1670, was for many years Keeper
of the Records in the Tower of London. Now we know
that Lord Essex, an intimate friend and connection of the
Earl of Southampton, and like Southampton a generous
and discerning patron of letters, was for some time in
the "free custody" of the Lord Keeper of the Tower.
Further, Southampton, who had joined Essex in his
rebellion, had been tried and convicted with his friend,
and though the Queen spared his life, he was not
released from the Tower until the ascension of James I.
It is not unlikely, therefore, that a copy of Nash's manuscript
made for Lord Essex passed, on the execution<a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;xiii]</span>
of the latter, with other papers and documents, into
the official custody of the Lord Keeper, to be subsequently
unearthed by his successor, Petyt, who, with a taste for the
"curious," had it copied for his own edification. This
supposition is further borne out as follows: The particular
commonplace book in which this poem occurs has been
written by various hands. In the same handwriting as,
and immediately preceding "The Choise of Valentines,"
are two poetical effusions dedicated "To the Earl of Essex,"
both apparently written when he was in prison and under
sentence of death. The other contents of the volume are
likewise contemporaneous.</p>
<p>
All things considered, then, the Petyt text, although
transcribed about fifty years later, has weightier claims to
attention than the version in the Rawlinson MSS. I have,
therefore, adopted the former as a basis, giving the
Rawlinson variations in the form of notes. A few of these
are obviously better readings than those of the Petyt
text: the reader cannot fail to distinguish these. In the
main, however, the Inner Temple version will be found
consistent with its particular dedication, whilst the Rawlinson
variations appear due to an attempt, signally unsuccessful,
to adapt the poem for general use.</p>
<p>
For the rest I have faithfully adhered to the original in
the basic text, and in the variorum readings, except in one
particular. The Rawlinson <i>MS.</i> is altogether guiltless of
punctuation, while the Petyt copy has been carelessly
"stopped" by the scribe: I have therefore given modern
punctuation.</p>

<a href="#Idr">d</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that Nash, in his dedication of the "Unfortunate Traveller," speaks
of it as his "first offering." This, however, must be taken rather as meaning his first
<i>serious</i> effort in acknowledgment of his patron's bounty, for in "The Terrors of the
Night" (registered on the 30th June, 1593), he somewhat effusively acknowledges his
indebtedness to Lord Southampton:&mdash;"Through him my tender wainscot studie doore is
delivered from much assault and battrie: through him I looke into, and am looked on in
the world: from whence otherwise I were a wretched banished exile. Through him all
my good is conueighed vnto me; and to him all my endeavours shall be contributed as
to the ocean." Again, as evidence that Nash had addressed himself to Southampton
prior to his dedication of "The Unfortunate Traveller," we glean from his promise
("Terrors of the Night") "to embroyder the rich store of his eternal renoune" in
"some longer Tractate."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Ie" id="Ie"></a>
<a href="#Ier">e</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time it must be stated that the scandal of the controversy between
Nash and Harvey became so notorious that in 1599 it was ordered by authority "that all
Nashes books and Dr. Harvey's books be taken wheresoever they may be found and
that none of the said books be ever printed hereafter" (COOPER, <i>Athenæ Cant.</i> ii. 306).</p>

impecunious all through his life, and probably reference is here made to some
bounty received at the hands of Lord Southampton (<i>see</i> Introduction). What patronage
meant at times is gleaned from Florio's dedication of <i>The Worlde of Wordes</i> in 1598 to
the same nobleman. He says:&mdash;"In truth I acknowledge an entire debt, not only of
my best knowledge, but of all; yea, of more than I know, or care, to your bounteous
lordship, in whose pay and patronage I have lived some years.... But, as to me,
and many more, the glorious and gracious sunshine of your honour hath infused light and
life." Rowe also tells a story of Lord Southampton's munificence to Shakspeare. It is
said that he gave the poet £1,000 (equal to £12,000 now-a-days) to complete a special
purchase. Whether this story be true or not, it is certain that Lord Southampton was
a most liberal patron of letters.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
